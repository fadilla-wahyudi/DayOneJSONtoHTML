# DayOneJSONtoHTML
This is a Python script that converts the exported JSON Day One journal entries into a single HTML file.

The output HTML file extracts the following information from the JSON file:
- Date and time of entry
- Latitude and longitude which is used to create a Google Map link
- Temperature and weather conditions
- Main text
- Photos, videos and audios (in M4A format)

I had to convert my videos to MP4 so that they're playable on a browser.
